## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Individual Sync Commands
```bash
# Sync contacts with debug output
python manage.py sync_hubspot_contacts_new --debug

# Dry run sync for appointments
python manage.py sync_hubspot_appointments_new --dry-run

# Full sync for deals with custom batch size
python manage.py sync_hubspot_deals_new --full --batch-size 50

# Incremental sync since specific date
python manage.py sync_hubspot_divisions_new --since 2023-01-01

# Sync associations between contacts and deals
python manage.py sync_hubspot_associations_new --from-object contacts --to-object deals
```

### Comprehensive Sync Command
```bash
# Run all sync operations
python manage.py sync_hubspot_all_new

# Run all with debug output and dry run
python manage.py sync_hubspot_all_new --debug --dry-run

# Run all with custom batch size, skip associations
python manage.py sync_hubspot_all_new --batch-size 200 --skip-associations

# Full sync for all entities
python manage.py sync_hubspot_all_new --full
```
