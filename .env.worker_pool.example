# Worker Pool Configuration Example
# Add this to your .env file or environment variables

# Maximum number of concurrent sync workers (default: 1)
# This controls how many sync tasks can run simultaneously
# Set to higher values (2-10) for more concurrent processing
# Set to 1 for sequential processing (safest for most setups)
MAX_SYNC_WORKERS=1

# Examples for different scenarios:
# For small setups or limited resources:
# MAX_SYNC_WORKERS=1

# For medium setups with good resources:
# MAX_SYNC_WORKERS=2

# For large setups with high-performance infrastructure:
# MAX_SYNC_WORKERS=3

# Note: Setting this too high can overwhelm your database
# and external APIs. Monitor performance and adjust accordingly.
